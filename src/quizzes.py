each language's lesson body. Options are deterministically shuffled per question
(same permutation for zh and en, so the correct letter matches across languages).

Quiz text (q/opts/why) is raw HTML in a text context (like the lesson body):
write literal ``<``/``&`` as ``&lt;``/``&amp;`` (or wrap code in ``<code>``).
